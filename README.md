# StandardFirmataYun

The Arduino Yun has both an Arduino (Atmega32u4) environment and a
Linux (Linino) environment.

StandardFirmataYun enables Firmata running on the Arduino environment
to communicate with a Firmata client application running on the Linux
environment.

Clone or download this repo into your Arduino sketch library, compile
and upload it to your Arduino Yun board.

You will need to install Firmata v2.5.0 via the Arduino library manager
if using Arduino v1.6.4+, or manually if using an older version of the
Arduino IDE. See the instructions on the [firmata/arduino](https://github.com/firmata/arduino) repo.
